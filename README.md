## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Frontend**
  - Node.js (v20 or higher)
  - npm (v10 or higher)
  - Modern web browser
- **Backend**
  - Python 3.11+
  - [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)
  - MongoDB (running locally or accessible remotely)

## Frontend Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-waste-management.git
   cd smart-waste-management/frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

## Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd ../backend
   ```

2. Create and activate a Python virtual environment (if not already created):
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   # On Windows:
   .\env\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source env/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install backend dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install flask flask-socketio flask-cors pymongo python-dotenv openrouteservice bson
   ```

4. Ensure MongoDB is running locally or update your configuration in `backend/config/config.py` to point to your MongoDB instance.

5. Create an `.env` file inside the backend direcotory with the following contnents:
    ```bash
    MONGO_URI = YOUR_MONGODB_URL
    MONGO_DB = NAME_OF_DB (ex. smartWaste)
    ORS = THE_OPENROUTESERVICE_KEY
    ```
    Go to OpenRouteService website to get the key.
6. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

6. The backend will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

## 💻 Usage

### Adding Bins
1. Select the "Bins" panel
2. Enter the number of bins to add
3. Choose fill level mode (auto or manual)
4. Click "Add Bins" to place them on the map

### Setting Up Vehicles
1. Select the "Vehicles" panel
2. Enter the number of vehicles
3. Set vehicle capacities
4. Click on the map to set the start location
5. Click "Add Vehicles" to register them

### Running Simulation
1. Click "Add Data" to send the current setup to the backend
2. Click "Run Simulation" to generate optimized routes
3. View the generated routes on the map
4. Check route details in the Route Details panel

## 🔧 System Limitations

### Map Interaction
- Refrain from tapping on the map, as it will add unnecessary markers
- Map markers cannot be dragged after placement
- Limited to one start location per simulation

### Bin Management
- The number of bins affects simulation performance as it will take more time to run the simulation
- Bin fill level must be between 0-100%
- Bins cannot be deleted once added

### Vehicle Constraints
- The number of vehicles affects simulation performance
- The number of vehicles does not mean the number of routes generated
- Vehicle capacity must be between 100-1000 units
- Start location must be set before adding vehicles

### Route Optimization
- Routes are optimized based on bin fill levels
- Routes cannot be manually modified after generation
- The number of bins in a route affects simulation performance
- Map clicks for start location won't affect route generation

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**
  - React.js
  - Tailwind CSS
  - Leaflet.js for maps
  - React Hot Toast for notifications

- **Backend**
  - Python
  - Flask (with Flask-SocketIO, Flask-CORS)
  - PyMongo (MongoDB)
  - OR-Tools for route optimization
  - OpenRouteService for map routing
  - python-dotenv for environment variables
